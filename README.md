## 🔬 Lab Programs

1. Implement a simple neural network with one hidden layer to classify basic data.
2. Data Preprocessing - Load and preprocess data, including normalization and splitting into training and testing sets.
3. Implementing Activation Functions -- Illustration of common activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, softmax) and apply them to a basic model.
4. Training a Model - Implement forward and backward propagation and train a simple neural network on a sample dataset.
5. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Build a basic CNN for image classification using a dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10.
6. Using Pre-trained Models - Load and fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet) for a new classification task.
7. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Text Data - Implement an RNN or LSTM model for simple text classification.
8. Generating Text with RNNs - Build an RNN to generate text based on a sequence of characters or words.
9. Final Project - Deep Learning Model on Custom Dataset
